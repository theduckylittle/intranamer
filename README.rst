IntraNamer
==========

This project does not have significance.  Its sole intention is to generate a list of names
from IMDb.  It uses today's date a heuristic for pulling down the appropriate actor(ess) and
movie names.

Why?
----

It was a Friday, we had exhausted our brain power from the previous week.  We couldn't come up
with a name for a project so we decided to let fate, numerology, and IMDb decide it for us.


Who can use this?
-----------------

Anyone who needs a pseudo-random name.  They must also have a Python interpreter.  And a version
of python with urllib2.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you're really concerned about this then you really haven't looked at the code.

How-to Run
----------

python name_my_project.py
